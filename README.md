# Football Betting Analysis

This project tries different betting strategies against NFL games over the period 1978 to 2009. None of them produce a positive outcome against a 5% betting cost with p=.95.

We DID find profitable strategies but only when applied to years like 1978â€”2000. And then we found out that these strategies had been published in 2000.

Data for outcomes and lines from: http://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html

This chart shows transitive (a beat b, then b beat c, bet on a beating c following week).
